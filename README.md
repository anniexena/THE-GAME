# Introduction
This is our final project for Creative Computing Studio, 
created by Annie Xenakis, Peyton Ludwig, Mollie Mero, and Atreyu McLewin.

Our game, *Forest's Peace*, is a 2D top-down pixel-art video game designed to raise 
awareness about sustainability through choice-based gameplay. Set in a fantasy world, 
players will make choices that directly influence the environment and the local community. 
With the power to either save or destroy the world, players will learn about the balance 
between rebuilding and preserving the environment.

# Key Features
1) Choice-based dialogue 
   This was created using a Dialogue Manager, Dialogue Trigger, and INK, a dialogue scripting language.
2) Cutting down trees + planting seeds
   Players can cut down trees to collect wood. They can also collect seeds from trees, or using their dog companion. 
   Seeds can be planted to grow more trees. Practicing sustainable habits when cutting and planting will lead to a
   more lively 
3) Rebuilding Houses
   Houses can be repared by left-clicking on them with the correct material.
   This will make the homeowner grateful, leading to a more prosperous town. 
4) Quests
   Quests are given by NPCs. They will ask you to either bring them wood, or request that you help them 
   repair their house. Quests are stored in a linked list.

# Third Party Resources
For this project, we used a few third-party resources:
1) CoPilot - To help with coding in C#
2) Mister Taft Creates (YouTube) - For his video tutorials on making 2D games in Unity
3) ChatGPT for learning Unity and debugging issues
4) Websites such as https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/ for sound effects
5) Websites such as https://www.freeconvert.com/webp-to-png and https://www.remove.bg/ for image editting
6) INK library for creating dialogue interactions

# Playing the Game
The full ZIP file of the final build was simply too massive to push onto this git, so we've included the following link that will let you download the final build:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/13LjSGH3rOUp1aaAbcOaW9U-Zw6Aj4K_o/view

Simply download and extract the contents, and then run the "THE-GAME.exe" file. This zip will have it's own readme.md file
